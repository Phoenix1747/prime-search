# prime-search
Very simple algorithm to search for prime numbers by dividing a candidate by all primes smaller than the square root of the candidate itself.

The number of found prime numbers will be printed to the output terminal and all numbers are saved into a file called `primes.txt` within the same directory.

You can also set an upper limit for the prime number search in the code itself. Have a look at the `unsigned int upperLimit` variable in `int main()` and adjust it to your likings. Standard upper limit is 1,000,000.
